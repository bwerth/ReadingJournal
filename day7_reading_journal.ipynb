If a string is passed, it will be broken up into separate characters. A tuple assignment is easier than regular variables. Switching variables can be done as follows: a, b = b, a. Divmod takes two arguments and returns a tuple composed of the quotient and the remainder. * gathers values into a tuple. It can also scatter a tuple. Zip takes any number of sequences and combines them into a defined number of tuples. The length of the shorter one is taken if the lengths are not the same. Items is a method on dictionaries that returns a list of tuples that each contain a key, value pair. Dict can be used to do the exact opposite. Tuples are commonly used as keys in dictionaries because lists cannot be used."
